# Data Structure Challenges (Part2)

The Data Structures Challenges Repository contains C++ solutions for various data structure challenges. Each challenge is encapsulated in its own class, providing a template for solving specific problems related to data structures. Each class is dedicated to constructing and implementing diverse data structures along with their associated operations. Additionally, it includes supplementary challenges aimed at deepening comprehension of data structure concepts and refining problem-solving skills.

## Challenges Included:

1. **Vector**
    - File: `clsVector.h`
    - Challenges:
        - `right_rotate` - Shifts every element one step towards the right, with the rightmost element moving to the first index.
        - `left_rotate` - Rotates the entire array one step to the left, with the leftmost element wrapping around to the back of the array.
        - `right_rotate(int times)` - Applies the right rotation a specified number of times (times).
        - `pop(int idx)` - Removes an element at the specified index (idx) and returns its value.
        - `find_transposition(int value)` - Improves search speed by shifting the found value one step to the left, bringing frequently queried values closer to the beginning of the array.


## Usage

To explore and utilize the project, navigate to each class and inspect the provided implementations, and tackle the challenges. You can also invoke the classes in the main function to experiment with their functionality.
